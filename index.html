Prior to working in banking, I graduated this past May with a bachelors degree in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science.</p>

      <p>I am a Jersey native and have lived in New Jersey my whole life. I was born in Jersey City and raised in Edison.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>While I have many hobbies, the main activities that I enjoy investing time into are eating, taking spontaneous naps, drawing, sewing, and binging some good anime.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I am currently still exploring what my dream job is. For now, I know that I enjoy mathematics and coding so ideally I would like to work in the tech industry for a place that embraces creativity such as Google or Facebook.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in Jersey City.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I love to code and am always eager to learn how to be well-versed in the technological tools used to express various forms of creativity. Hence, I've always held an interest in developing applications because there is so much flexibility in the projects one can create.</p>
